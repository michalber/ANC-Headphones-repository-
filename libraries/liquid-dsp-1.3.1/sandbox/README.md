liquid-dsp sandbox
==================

This directory is the sandbox for prototyping DSP processing
elements in liquid.  It contains a number of scripts which are used
for testing and prototyping certain signal processing algorithms.
Its primary function is to validate functional correctness without
adding unnecessary code to the main project files.

All the programs in this directory can be build by invoking 'make'
from the root directory, viz.

    $ make sandbox
