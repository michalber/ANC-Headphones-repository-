\section{agc (automatic gain control)}
\label{module:agc}
Normalizing the level of an incoming signal is a critical step in
many wireless communications systems
and is necessary before further processing can happen in the receiver.
This is particularly necessary in digital
modulation schemes which encode information in the signal amplitude
(e.g. see {\tt MOD\_QAM} in \S\ref{module:modem:digital}).
Furthermore, loop filters for tracking carrier and symbol timing are highly
sensitive to signal levels and require some degree of amplitude
normalization.
As such automatic gain control plays a crucial role in SDR.
The ideal AGC has a transfer function as in
Figure~\ref{fig:module:agc:transfer_function}.
When the input signal level is low, the AGC is disabled and the output is a
linear function of the input.
When the input level reaches a lower threshold, $e_0$, the AGC becomes active
and the output level is maintained at the target (unity) until the input
reaches its upper limit, $e_1$.
The AGC is disabled at this point, and the output level is again a linear
function of the input.

\liquid\ implements automatic gain controlling with the {\tt agc\_xxxt}
family of objects.
The goal is to estimate the gain required to force a signal to have a
unity target energy.
Operating one sample at a time, the {\tt agc} object makes an estimate
$\hat{e}$ of the signal energy and updates the internal gain $g$,
applying it to the input to produce an output with the target energy.
The gain estimate is updated by way of an open loop filter whose bandwidth
determines the update rate of the AGC.

\subsection{Theory}
\label{module:agc:theory}
Given an input signal
%$\vec{x} = [\vec{x}_0, \vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_{N-1}]$,
$\vec{x} = \{ x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{N-1} \}$,
its energy is computed as its $L_2$ norm over the entire sequence, viz
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:agc:energy}
    E\{ \|\vec{x}\| \} = 
        \left[
            \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} {\|x_k^2\|}
        \right]^{1/2}
\end{equation}
%For a continuous signal, this is
%\[
%    E\{\| x(t) \|\} =
%        \sqrt{
%            \frac{1}{T}\int_0^{T} { x^2(t) dt }
%        }
%\]
For received communications signals, however, the goal is to adjust to the
gain of the receiver relative to the slowly-varying amplitude of the incoming
receiver due to shadowing, path loss, etc.
%Furthermore, it is impractical to estimate the signal energy of an entire
%vector for each sample of input.
Therefore it is necessary to make an estimate of the signal energy over
a short period of time.
This is accomplished by computing the average of only the previous $M$
samples of $|x|^2$; \liquid\ uses an internal buffer size of $M=16$
samples.
Now that the short-time signal energy has been estimated, all that remains is to
adjust the gain of the receiver accordingly.
\liquid\ implements an open-loop gain control by adjusting the
instantaneous gain value to match the estimated signal energy to drive
the output level to unity.
The loop filter for the gain is a first-order recursive low-pass filter
with the transfer function defined as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:agc:loop_filter}
    H_g(z) =
        \frac{
            \alpha
        }{
            1 - (1-\alpha) z^{-1}
        }
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha \triangleq \sqrt{\omega}$.
%
In order to achieve a unity target energy, the instantaneous ideal gain is
therefore the inverse of the estimated signal level,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:agc:default:ghat}
    \hat{g}_{k} = \sqrt{1 / \hat{e}_k}
\end{equation}
%
Rather than applying the gain directly to the input signal it is first
filtered as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:agc:default:g}
    g_{k} = \alpha \hat{g}_{k} + (1-\alpha) g_{k-1}
\end{equation}
%
where again $\alpha \triangleq \sqrt{\omega}$ is the smoothing factor of
the gain estimate and controls the attack and release time the {\tt agc}
object has on an input signal.
Because $\alpha$ is typically small, the updated internal gain $g_{k}$
retains most of its previous gain value $g_{k-1}$ but adds a small
portion of its new estimate $\hat{g}_{k}$.


\subsection{Locking}
\label{module:agc:locking}
The {\tt agc} object permits the gain to be locked when, for example,
the header of a frame has been received.
This is useful for effectively switching the AGC on and off during short,
burst-mode frame transmissions, particularly when the signal has a high-order
digital amplitude-modulation (e.g. 64-QAM) and fluctuations in the AGC
could potentially result in symbol errors.
%
When the {\tt agc} object is locked, the internal gain control is not
updated,
and the internal gain at the time of locking is applied directly to the
output signal, forcing $g_k = g_{k-1}$.
%
Locking and unlocking is accomplished with the
{\tt agc\_crcf\_lock()} and
{\tt agc\_crcf\_unlock()} methods, respectively.

\subsection{Squelch}
\label{module:agc:squelch}
The {\tt agc} object contains internal squelch control to allow the
receiver the ability to disable signal processing when the signal
level is too low.
In traditional radio design, the squelch circuit suppressed the output
of a receiver when the signal strength would fall below a certain level,
primarily used to prevent audio static due to noise when no other
operators were transmitting.
Having said that, the squelch control in \liquid\ is actually somewhat
of a misnomer as it doesn't actually control the AGC, but rather just
monitors the dynamics of the signal level and returns its status to the
controlling unit.
The squelch control follows six states|enabled, rising edge trigger,
signal high, falling edge trigger, signal low, and timeout|as depicted
in Figure~\ref{fig:module:agc:squelch} and
Table~\ref{tab:module:agc:squelch_codes}.
These states give the user flexibility in programming networks where
frames are transmitted in short bursts and the receiver needs to
synchronize quickly.
The status of the squelch control is retrieved via the
{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_get\_status()} method.

The typical control cycle for the AGC squelch is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:module:agc:squelch}.
Initially, squelch is enabled (code {\tt 0}) as the signal has been low for
quite some time.
When the beginning of a frame is received, the RSSI increases beyond the
squelch threshold (code {\tt 1}).
All subsequent samples above this threshold return a ``signal high'' status
(code {\tt 2}).
Once the signal level falls below the threshold, the squelch returns a
``falling edge trigger'' status (code {\tt 3}).
All subsequent samples below the threshold until timing out return a ``signal
low'' status (code {\tt 4}).
When the signal has been low for a sufficient period of time (defined by the
user), the squelch will return a ``timeout'' status (code {\tt 5}).
All subsequent samples below the threshold will return a ``squelch enabled''
status.

\subsubsection{Methodology}
\label{module:agc:squelch:methodology}
The reason for all six states (as opposed to just ``squelch on'' and ``squelch
off'') are to allow for the AGC to adjust to complex signal dynamics.
The default operation for the AGC is to {\it disable} the squelch.
For example if the AGC squelch control is in ``signal low'' mode
(state {\tt 4}) and the signal increases above the threshold before timeout,
the AGC will move back to the ``signal high'' mode (state {\tt 2}).
This is particularly useful for weak signals whose received signal strength is
hovering around the squelch threshold; it would be undesirable for the AGC to
enable the squelch in the middle of receiving a frame!

\subsubsection{auto-squelch}
\label{module:agc:squelch:auto}
The AGC module also allows for an auto-squelch mechanism which attempts to
track the signal threshold to the noise floor of the receiver.
This is accomplished by monitoring the signal level when squelch is enabled.
The auto-squelch mechanism has a 4dB headroom; if the signal level drops below
4dB beneath the squelch threshold, the threshold will be decremented.
This is useful for receiving weak signals slightly above the noise floor,
particularly when the exact noise floor is not known or varies slightly over
time.
Auto-squelch is enabled/disabled using the
{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_enable\_auto()} and 
{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_disable\_auto()} methods respectively.

\subsection{Interface}
\label{module:agc:squelch:interface}
Listed below is the full interface to the {\tt agc} family of objects.
While each method is listed for the {\tt agc\_crcf} object, the same
functionality applies to the {\tt agc\_rrrf} object.
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_create()}]
    creates an {\tt agc} object with default parameters.
    By default the minimum gain is $10^{-6}$, the maximum gain is $10^6$, the
    initial gain is $1$, and the estimate of the input signal level is $0$.
    Also the AGC type is set to {\tt LIQUID\_AGC\_DEFAULT}.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_destroy(q)}]
    destroys the object, freeing all internally-allocated memory.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_print(q)}]
    prints the {\tt agc} object's internals to {\tt stdout}.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_reset(q)}]
    resets the state of the {\tt agc} object.
    This unlocks the AGC and clears the estimate of the input signal level.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_set\_gain\_limits(q,gmin,gmax)}]
    sets the minimum and maximum gain values, respectively.
    This effectively specifies $e_0$ and $e_1$ as in
    Figure~\ref{fig:module:agc:transfer_function}.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_lock(q)}]
    prevents the AGC from updating its gain estimate.
    The internal gain is stored at the time of lock and used for all
    subsequent occurrences of {\tt \_execute()}.
    This is primarily used when the beginning of a frame has been detected,
    and perhaps the payload contains amplitude-modulated data which can be
    corrupted with the AGC aggressively attacking the signal's high
    dynamics.
    Also, locking the AGC conserves clock cycles as the gain update is
    not computed.
    Typically, the locked AGC consumes about $5\times$ fewer clock
    cycles than its unlocked state.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_unlock(q)}]
    unlocks the AGC from a locked state and resumes estimating the input
    signal level and internal gain.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_execute(q,x,y)}]
    applies the gain to the input $x$, storing in the output sample $y$
    and updates the AGC's internal tracking loops (of not locked).
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_get\_signal\_level(q)}]
    returns a linear estimate of the input signal's energy level.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_get\_rssi(q)}]
    returns an estimate of the input signal's energy level in dB.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_get\_gain(q)}]
    returns the {\tt agc} object's internal gain.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_activate(q)}]
    activates the AGC's squelch module.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_deactivate(q)}]
    deactivates the AGC's squelch module.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_enable\_auto(q)}]
    activates the AGC's automatic squelch module.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_disable\_auto(q)}]
    deactivates the AGC's automatic squelch module.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_set\_threshold(q,t)}]
    sets the threshold of the squelch.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_set\_timeout(q,t)}]
    sets the timeout (number of samples) after the signal level has dropped
    before enabling the squelch again.
\item[{\tt agc\_crcf\_squelch\_get\_status(q)}]
    returns the squelch status code
    (see Table~\ref{tab:module:agc:squelch_codes}).
