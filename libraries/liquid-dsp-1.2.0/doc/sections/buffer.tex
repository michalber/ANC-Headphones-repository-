\section{buffer}
\label{module:buffer}
The buffer module includes objects for storing, retrieving, and
interfacing with buffered data samples.


\subsection{{\tt window} buffer}
\label{module:buffer:window}
The {\tt window} object is used to implement a sliding window buffer.
It is essentially a first-in, first-out queue but with the constraint that a
fixed number of elements is always available, and the ability to read the
entire queue at once.
This is particularly useful for filtering objects which use time-domain
convolution of a fixed length to compute its outputs.
The {\tt window} objects operate on a known data type, e.g.
{\it float} ({\tt windowf}), and
{\it float complex} ({\tt windowcf}).
%{\it unsigned int} ({\tt uiwindow}).

The buffer has a fixed number of elements which are initially zeros.
Values may be pushed into the end of the buffer (into the ``right'' side)
using the {\tt push()} method, or written in blocks via {\tt write()}.
In both cases the oldest data samples are removed from the buffer (out of the
``left'' side).
When it is necessary to read the contents of the buffer, the {\tt read()}
method returns a pointer to its contents.
\liquid\ implements this shifting method in the same manner as a ring buffer,
and linearizes the data very efficiently, without performing any unnecessary
data memory copies.
Effectively, the window looks like:

Listed below is the full interface for the {\tt window} family of
objects.
While each method is listed for {\tt windowcf}
(a window with {\tt float complex} elements),
the same functionality applies to the {\tt windowf} object.
%
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt windowcf\_create(n)}]
    creates a new window with an internal length of $n$ samples.
\item[{\tt windowcf\_recreate(q,n)}]
    extends an existing window's size, similar to the standard C library's
    {\tt realloc()} to $n$ samples.
    If the size of the new window is larger than the old one, the newest
    values are retained at the beginning of the buffer and the oldest
    values are truncated.

    oldest values are truncated.

\item[{\tt windowcf\_destroy(q)}]
    destroys the object, freeing all internally-allocated memory.
\item[{\tt windowcf\_clear(q)}]
    clears the contents of the buffer by setting all internal values to zero.
\item[{\tt windowcf\_index(q,i,*v)}]
    retrieves the $i^{th}$ sample in the window, storing the output
    value in $v$.
    This is equivalent to first invoking {\tt read()} and then indexing
    on the resulting pointer;
    however the result is obtained much faster.
    Therefore invoking {\tt windowcf\_index(q,0,*v)} returns the
    {\em oldest} value in the window.
\item[{\tt windowcf\_read(q,**r)}]
    reads the contents of the window by returning a pointer to the
    aligned internal memory array.
    This method guarantees that the elements are linearized.
    This method should {\em only} be used for reading; writing values to
    the buffer has unspecified results.
\item[{\tt windowcf\_push(q,v)}]
    shifts a single sample $v$ into the right side of the window,
    pushing the oldest (left-most) sample out of the end.
    Unlike stacks, the {\tt windowcf} object has no equivalent ``pop''
    method, as values are retained in memory until they are overwritten.
\item[{\tt windowcf\_write(q,*v,n)}]
    writes a block of $n$ samples in the array $\vec{v}$ to the window.
    Effectively, it is equivalent to pushing each sample one at a time,
    but executes much faster.
\end{description}

Here is an example demonstrating the basic functionality of the window object.
The comments show the internal state of the window after each function call as
if the window were a simple C array.

\subsection{{\tt wdelay} delay buffer}
\label{module:buffer:wdelay}
The {\tt wdelay} object in \liquid\ implements a an efficient digital
delay line with a minimal amount of memory.
Specifically, the transfer function is just
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:buffer:wdelay}
    H_d(z) = z^{-k}
\end{equation}
%
where $k$ is the number of samples of delay.
%
The interface for the {\tt wdelay} family of objects is listed below.
While the interface is given for {\tt wdelayf} for floating-point
precision, equivalent interfaces exist for
{\tt float complex} with {\tt wdelaycf}.
%
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt wdelayf\_create(k)}]
    creates a new {\tt wdelayf} object with a delay of $k$ samples.
\item[{\tt wdelayf\_recreate(q,k)}]
    adjusts the delay size, preserving the internal state of the object.
\item[{\tt wdelayf\_destroy(q)}]
    destroys the object, freeing all internally-allocated memory.
\item[{\tt wdelayf\_print(q)}]
    prints the object's properties internal state to the standard
    output.
\item[{\tt wdelayf\_clear(q)}]
    clears the contents of the internal buffer by setting all values to
    zero.
\item[{\tt wdelayf\_read(q,y)}]
    reads the sample at the head of the buffer and stores it to the
    output pointer.
\item[{\tt wdelayf\_push(q,x)}]
    pushes a sample into the buffer.
\end{description}
