# liquid-dsp modem phase error data
#
This directory contains phase error data for the many different
modulation schemes available in liquid, including QAM, PSK, APSK, ASK,
and many arbitrary schemes. Each file in this directory contains
simulation data run over many trials by stepping the phase rotation of
a received constellation for a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
averaging the phase error estimate of the demodulator.
