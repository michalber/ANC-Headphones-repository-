\section{sequence}
\label{module:sequence}
The sequence module implements a number of binary sequencing objects
useful for communications,
including
generic binary shift registers,
linear feedback shift registers,
maximal length codes ($m$-sequences),
and
complementary codes.

\subsection{{\tt bsequence}, generic binary sequence}
\label{module:sequence:bsequence}
The {\tt bsequence} object implements a generic binary shift register
and is particularly useful in wireless communications for correlating long
bit sequences in seeking frame preambles and packet headers.
%This is also useful in the physical layer description 
The {\tt bsequence} object internally stores its sequence of bits as an array
of bytes which handles shifting values even faster than the {\tt window}
family of objects.
%
Listed below is the basic interface to the {\tt bseqeunce} object:
%
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt bsequence\_create(n)}]
    creates a {\tt bsequence} object with $n$ bits,
    filled initially with zeros.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_destroy(q)}]
    destroys the object, freeing all internally-allocated memory.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_clear(q)}]
    resets the sequence to all zeros.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_init(q,*v)}]
    initializes the sequence on an external array of bytes,
    compactly representing a string of bits.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_print(q)}]
    prints the contents of the sequence to the screen.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_push(q,bit)}]
    pushes a bit into the back (right side) of a binary sequence, and in
    turn drops the left-most bit.
    Only the right-most (least-significant) bit of the input is regarded.
    For example, pushing a {\tt 1} into the sequence {\tt 0010011}
    results in {\tt 0100111}.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_circshift(q)}]
    circularly shifts a binary sequence left, pushing the left-most bit
    back into the right-most position.
    For example, invoking a circular shift on the sequence {\tt 1001110}
    results in {\tt 0011101}.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_correlate(q0,q1)}]
    runs a binary correlation of two {\tt bsequence} objects
    {\tt q0} and {\tt q1},
    returning the number of similar bits in both sequences.
    For example, correlating the sequence
    {\tt 11110000} with
    {\tt 11001100}
    yields {\tt 4}.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_add(q0,q1,q2)}]
    computes the binary addition of two sequences {\tt q0} and {\tt q1}
    storing the result in a third sequence {\tt q2}.
    Binary addition of two bits is equivalent to their logical
    {\em exclusive or}, $\oplus$.
    For example, the binary addition of
    {\tt 01100011} and
    {\tt 11011001} is
    {\tt 10111010}.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_mul(q0,q1,q2)}]
    computes the binary multiplication of two sequences
    {\tt q0} and {\tt q1}
    storing the result in a third sequence {\tt q2}.
    Binary multiplication of two bits is equivalent to their logical
    {\em and}, $\land$.
    For example, the binary multiplication of
    {\tt 01100011} and
    {\tt 11011001} is
    {\tt 01000001}.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_accumulate(q)}]
    returns the {\tt 1}s in a binary sequence.
\item[{\tt bsequence\_get\_length(q)}]
    returns the length of the sequence (number of bits).
\item[{\tt bsequence\_index(q,i)}]
    returns the bit at a particular index of the sequence,
    starting from the right-most bit.
    For example, indexing the sequence {\tt 00000001}
    at index {\tt 0}
    gives the value {\tt 1}.
\end{description}


\subsection{{\tt msequence}, $m$-sequence (linear feedback shift register)}
\label{module:sequence:msequence}
The {\tt msequence} object in \liquid\ is really just a linear feedback shift
register (LFSR), efficiently implemented using unsigned integers.
The LFSR consists of an $m$-bit shift register, $v$, and generator polynomial
$g$.
For primitive polynomials, the output sequence has a length $n=2^m-1$ before
repeating.
This sequence is known as a maximal-length P/N (positive/negative) sequence,
and consists of several useful properties:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item the output sequence has very good auto-correlation properties; when
      aligned, the sequence, of course, correlates perfectly to 1.
      When misaligned by any amount, however, the sequence correlates to
      exactly $-1/n$.
\item the sequence is easily generated using a linear feedback shift register
\end{enumerate}
%
Only a certain subset of all possible generator polynomials produce this
maximal length sequence.

The default generator polynomials are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:sequence:genpoly}, however many more exist.%
\footnote{
    A list of all $m$-sequence generator polynomials are provided in
    {\tt doc/data/msequence} located in the main \liquid\ project
    directory.}
Notice that both the first and last bit of each generator polynomial is a
{\tt 1}.
This holds true for all $m$-sequence generator polynomials.
All generator polynomials of length $m=2$ $(n=3)$ through $m=15$ $(n=32767)$
are given in the {\tt data/msequence/} subdirectory of this documentation
directory.

Here is a brief description of the {\tt msequence} object's interface in
\liquid:
%
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt msequence\_create(m,g,a)}]
    creates an {\tt msequence} object with an internal shift register
    length of $m$ bits using a generator polynomial $g$ and the initial
    state of the shift register $a$.
\item[{\tt msequence\_create\_default(m)}]
    creates an {\tt msequence} object with $m$ bits in the shift
    register using the default generator polynomial
    (e.g. {\tt LIQUID\_MSEQUENCE\_GENPOLY\_M6}).
    The initial state is set to {\tt 000...001}.
\item[{\tt msequence\_destroy(ms)}]
    destroys the object {\tt ms}, freeing all internal memory.
\item[{\tt msequence\_print(ms)}]
    prints the contents of the sequence to the screen.
\item[{\tt msequence\_advance(ms)}]
    advances the {\tt msequence} object's shift register by computing the
    binary dot product of the register with the generator polynomial.
    The resulting bit is sum of {\tt 1}s modulo 2 of the dot product and is
    fed back into the end of the shift register, as well as returned to the
    user.
\item[{\tt msequence\_generate\_symbol(ms,bps)}]
    generates a pseudo-random {\tt bps}-bit symbol from the shift register.
    This is accomplished by advancing the {\tt msequence} object {\tt bps}
    times and shifting the result back into the symbol.
    It is important to note that because the sequence repeats every $n$ bits,
    if the random number is an even multiple of $n$, the random sequence will
    repeat every {\tt bps} symbols.
    For example, if $m=4$ ($n=15$) and {\tt \_bps} is 3, then the sequence
    will repeat 5 times.
\item[{\tt msequence\_reset(ms)}]
    resets the {\tt msequence} object's internal shift register to the
    original state (typically {\tt 000...001}).
\item[{\tt msequence\_get\_length(ms)}]
    returns the length of the sequence, $n$
\item[{\tt msequence\_get\_state(ms)}]
    returns the internal state of the sequence, $v$

%
The auto-correlation of the $m$-sequence with generator polynomial
$g=${\tt 1000011}
can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:module:sequence:msequence}.
The shift register has six bits ($m=6$) and therefore the output sequence is
of length $n=2^m-1=63$.
Notice that the auto-correlation is equal to unity with no delay, and nearly
zero ($-1/63$) for all other delays.



\subsection{complementary codes}
\label{module:sequence:ccodes}
In addition to $m$-sequences, \liquid\ also implements complementary codes:
P/N sequence pairs which have similar properties to $m$-sequences.
A complementary code pair is one in which the sum of individual
auto-correlations is identically zero for all delays except for the zero-delay
which provides an auto-correlation of unity.
%
The two codes $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are generated recursively as
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \vec{a}_{k+1} & = & \left[ \vec{a}_k \,\,\,      \vec{b}_k  \right] \\
    \vec{b}_{k+1} & = & \left[ \vec{a}_k \,\,\, \bar{\vec{b}}_k \right] \\
\end{eqnarray*}
where $[\cdot,\cdot]$ represents concatenation and
$\bar{(\cdot)}$ denotes a binary inversion.
Table~\ref{tab:sequence:ccodes} shows the first several iterations of the
sequence.
Notice that the sequence length doubles for each iteration, and that (with the
exception of $k=0$) the first half of $\vec{a}_k$ and $\vec{b}_k$ are
identical.
Figure~\ref{fig:module:sequence:ccodes} shows that the auto-correlation of the two
sequences is non-zero for delays other than zero, but that they indeed do sum
to zero.
